## Intro

I bought a 13x18 camera [^1]. An unknown (brand) one. A wooden one. A beautiful one. It’s old. It has some scratches. However, each beauty deserves to survive and hence, it needs some restoration. This repository will collect all information I can find about the cam, as well as a plan to refurbish it.

## Who built the Cam?

At time of purchase and at present, the maker is unknown to me. It's clear 

This chapter will collect all indicators that may point to an known maker/brand.

## Findings

[^1]: A 13x18 ratio sounds weird? These are centimeters. The corresponding inch ratio is 5x7.
