# 2. Intro

I bought a 13x18 camera [^1]. An unknown (brand) one. A wooden one. A beautiful one. Itâ€™s old. It has some scratches. However, each beauty deserves to survive and hence, it needs some restoration. This repository will collect all information I can find about the cam, as well as a plan to refurbish it.

[^1]: A 13x18 ratio sounds weird? These are centimeters. The corresponding inch ratio is 5x7.
